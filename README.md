DrGeo Smalltalk Sketches for propositions of Euclid's Elements (Heiberg Teubneriana Edition)

DrGeo is a Smalltalk system for geometry (running on Cuis Smalltalk).
Greek characters can be used in DrGeo using \alpha \beta etc.
See the method #initializeNamedCharactersMap

The source of the sketches is the I.L.Heiberg and H.Menge edition of Euclid's Elementa from the Bibliotheca Scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana.

This is the Classical Greek and Latin edition of what could have been Euclid's "Elementa Euclidis".

This is a multi-volume critical edition of what Euclid's work could have been, mostly based on a manuscript from the Vatican library, but also on some other manuscripts.

My understanding is that the Latin translation was by Heiberg and Menge themselves, and that they worked mostly from Greek language sources.

The first volume of this series of books bundles some of the Elementa's books.

Book 1 

	prop 1.  equilateral triangle (isopleuron)

Book 3

	prop 3.  bisector of tangent lines for a circle
	prop 20. central angle vs angle on perimeter (peripheria)

Book 4

	prop 4.  inscribe circle in a triangle
	prop 5.  circumscribe circle around triangle
